pgn-extract is a command-line program for searching, manipulating and formatting chess games recorded in the
Portable Game Notation (PGN) or something close. It is capable of handling files containing millions of games.  It
also recognises Chess960 encodings.

There are many different ways to select games from PGN files, based on tags, moves, positions reached, game
results, etc.

The program has been actively maintained by its author, David Barnes, since 1994, and is widely used in the global
chess community.
