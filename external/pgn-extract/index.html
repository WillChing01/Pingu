<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the home page for
the <em>pgn-extract</em> program,
which is a <em>command-line</em> program for searching, manipulating and formatting
chess games recorded in the Portable Game Notation (PGN) or something close. It
is capable of handling files containing millions of games. It also recognises Chess960
encodings.
<p>A <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/help.html">full
description of pgn-extract's functionality</a> is available and included
with the sources.

<p>Here you can find the C source code and Windows binaries for the current
version.
pgn-extract compiles and runs under Windows, Linux and macOS.
This program is made available under the terms of the
<a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~djb/pgn-extract/COPYING">GNU
General Public License (Version 3).</a>

<h2>Getting-started video for Windows users</h2>
<p>For Windows users who are really only interested in getting
the binary working, there is <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~djb/pgn-extract/intro.mp4">a short introductory video</a>.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The program is designed to make it easy to extract and format selected games from a
PGN format data file based on a wide variety of criteria.
The criteria include:
<ul>
<li><p>textual move sequences;</p></li>
<li><p>the position reached after a sequence of moves;</p></li>
<li><p>information in the tag fields;</p></li>
<li><p>fuzzy board position;</p></li>
<li><p>and material balance in the ending.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the on-going 30+ year course of its development, it has also added
lots of features for controlling what is output (e.g., different
algebraic formats, EPD, no move numbers, restricting game length, etc.)

<p>The program includes a semantic analyser which will
report errors in game scores and it is also able to detect duplicate
games found in its input files.

<p>The range of input move formats accepted is fairly wide.
The output is normally in English Standard
Algebraic Notation (SAN) but this can be varied to long-algebraic or UCI,
for instance.

<p>Extracted games may be written out either including or excluding
comments, NAGs, variations, move numbers, tags and/or results.
Games may be given ECO classifications
derived from the accompanying file eco.pgn, or a customised version
provided by the user.

<p>The program is designed to be relatively memory-friendly, so it
does not retain a game's moves in memory once it has been processed.
This also makes it suitable for bulk processing very large collections of games
- it can efficiently process files containing several millions of games.

<p>Use the <em>--help</em> argument to the program to
get the full lists of arguments.

<h2>Most recent changes</h2>
<p>These are the main changes in this version:
<ul>
    <li><p>bug fix for repetition detection (--repetition);
    <li><p>find games whether the winner is either the higher or lower rated player (--lowerratedwinner and
    --higherratedwinner);
    <li><p>extend -v to match move sequences anywhere in a game, not just at the start (--vanywhere);
    <li><p>find games played at odds (--odds).
</ul>

<h2>Blog post about data mining with pgn-extract</h2>
<p>In October 2018 I wrote <a href="http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/djb/2018/10/14/data-mining-with-pgn-extract/">blog post</a>
about using pgn-extract to mine a PGN database. 
As an example it looks at the effect of having a bishop pair versus a knight pair.

<h2>Answers on Chess StackExchange using pgn-extract</h2>
<p>I am active on <a href="https://chess.stackexchange.com/">Chess StackExchange</a> as
<a href="https://chess.stackexchange.com/users/12951/kentdjb">kentdjb</a>
and aim to respond to pgn-extract related questions, although email to me is my preferred way to raise
potential issues with the program.
<p>From time to time, I have provided answers to questions that involve
the use of pgn-extract for analysis tasks:
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/23938/is-there-a-record-for-threefold-repetition-for-when-the-claimed-positions-are-th/24276#24276">Three-fold repetition</a>.
  <li><p><a href="https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/24166/what-professional-game-has-the-quickest-sequence-starting-from-move-one-to-qua/24274#24274">Quadrupled pawns</a>.
  <li><p><a
  href="https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/24245/how-often-does-castling-occur-in-grandmaster-games/24247#24247">Frequency of occurrence of castling</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback and suggestions for further features are always welcome, although I can't always
promise to undertake significant development work.
